Personal website and blog using:

- Astro
- Tailwind 4 + Typography
- Vercel

I may be switching/switched from Hugo in April 2025. I built this site primarily
using Vercel's v0 for the layout and previewing and Gemini 2.5 Pro. The styling
is heavily based off of
[PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/).

## Usage

Run local server:

```
pnpm dev
```

Make a new post (creates a new Markdown file in content/blog/ folder using
app/templates/blog.md as a template):

```
pnpm blog "Cool new post"
```
