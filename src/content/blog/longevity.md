I've been a bit of a health junkie for most of my life. I've been trying to
figure it all out. It seems to be the most confusing science that there has
been.

I've recently learned that exercise should not be the primary way we lose
weight. Exercise will help you lose weight up to a point where you plateau. This
only affects you if you haven't worked out much before.

This is a segaway into the actual topic of this post: longevity. There's a whole
community behind this. It can be very confusing. In the spirit of the community,
I am just here to refine my personal journey and share it with others. I am not
a guru, just here to share what may or may not be working for me. This is an
ongoing project where my research and knowledge will keep going on. There will
probably be more parts to this later.

A large amount of my findings and research will be extrapolated from Peter
Attia's Outlive. This is the basis of my research with other non-fiction I've
read. He is not the SPOT (single point of truth), but he has given me a
framework in which to view all other ways to "improve" overall health.
