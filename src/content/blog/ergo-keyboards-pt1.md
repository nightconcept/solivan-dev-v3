# Ergonomic Keyboards, Part 1

## The Problem

I started work as a software engineer about 7 months ago now. With many long
hours sitting and staring at the screen, I realized that my hands and arms were
hurting. I also noticed my eyes were hurting, but I resolved that by being more
dedicated to following my [Stretchly](https://hovancik.net/stretchly/) routines
(every 20 minutes, start at something 20 ft away for 20 seconds and every hour,
take a 2 minute walk). I started researching into keyboards to see if they would
help me.

## The Requirements

I stumbled upon Reddit's [r/ergomechkeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/) community to
see what keybards were available. I had spent some time previously looking at
just regular mechanical keyboards, but I stopped when I realized I _hated_
putting in o-rings. I immediately stopped considering new keyboards altogether.
Anyways, after an excessive amount of browsing, I settled on the following
criteria for an ergonomic mechanical keyboard:

- **Mechanical** - I don't think there's a non-mechanical option anyways, but
  nonetheless a requirement!
- **Hotswappable** - I still don't really know what mechanical switch I like
  using.
- **Split** - Left and right sections of the keyboard split in order to open up
  the chest.
- **Pre-built** - I did not want to do much assembly. Especially no soldering.

I did have other considerations I wasn't sure about that were relatively new to
me:

- **Ortholinear** - In this configuration, keys are in a square grid rather than
  offset like regular QWERTY keyboards. The
  [Planck](https://olkb.com/collections/planck) is a good example of an
  ortholinear keyboard.
- **Columnar Stagger** - In this configuration, keys are staggered only
  vertically because each finger has a different length. This configuration. The
  [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) is a good example of a
  columnar stagger (also split) keyboard.
- **RGB Lighting** - Not really a hard requirement, but a nice to have
  especially for keyboards at home where I might be typing more often in the
  dark. I will not be looking at the keys while I type because I am a decent
  touch typist, but it helps for visibility. At work, this is a non-issue as the
  lights are always on.

With the requirements defined, I set out on my journey to shop around. I
probably spent way too much of course as is the case with many people into
mechanical keyboards.

## The Solution(s)

From all the reading of people's experiences with ergo-mechs, I knew I was going
to need to progress through keyboards rather than finding my "endgame" keyboard
right away.

### Keychron Q11 (At Home, Daily Driver)

The
[Keychron Q11](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q11-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard)
was the first split keyboard I bought. Keychron has some beautiful keyboards and
I always knew I wanted one. The Q11 is a 75% split keyboard with hot-swappable
switches. The version I ordered has red (linear) Gateron G Pro switches and OSA
keycaps. It also has QMK/VIA firmware (firmware to be discussed later!).

I use this keyboard as my daily driver keyboard at home at desktop which I use
for almost everything. This keyboard feels solid and weighty, looks beautiful
with the default keycaps, and makes a solid thock sound. This keyboard is my
first keyboard with red switches and that's when I realized I love the linearity
when typing on them. I don't do much twitch-shooter gaming anymore, but I
probably wouldn't mind the lack of a tactile feel on this keyboard when I do
play a twitch-shooter.

This keyboard has helped my shoulders stay more open with the split. I realized
I wanted to try a little more. I really looked into columnar stagger and tenting
as options to give more relief to my arms. I really wanted to stop the pain and
prevent potential future RSIs.

My only complaint about this keyboard is the lack of a dedicated "end" key. I
realized I use this very often to navigate code or text lines quickly. It feels
awkward having a "home" key, but no "end" key.

### RK Royal Kludge RKS70 (Returned)

I found this solid budget split keyboard on Amazon. It was only $75 when I
bought it and it had tenting and wireless options on it. It is still only a
horizontal stagger (traditional keyboard), but I also needed a keyboard for work
where I am typing at 3 days a week.

However, I found out very quickly this was not the keyboard for me. They say
it's a 75% keyboard, but it's actually a 65% keyboard which doesn't have the
funciton keys. As a software engineer, I do need to use the function keys (F5
and F11 specifically) as keys for debugging. This keyboard doesn't have
customizability to add layers (which at the time I wasn't even thinking about)
so I could not just add them. The default `fn` key was just in an awkward
position and I don't like using them to toggle them on and off. I just wasn't
(and am still not) ready to do that.

One thing I did get to test with this was tenting. It has two levels of tenting
available with legs you can change out (if I remember correctly) .It was
uncomfortable at both levels and awkward for my hands. This is despite my hands
"default" resting position is a little tented, they feel better laying flat-ish.

I returned this and moved on to the...

### Mistel Barocco MD770 (At Work, Daily Driver)

I verified that my next keyboard was indeed a 75% keyboard. This is a true 75%
split, horizontal stagger keyboard. I ordered a version with silent red linear
(unknown brand?) switches. I decided I wanted to try out silent reds to see if
they were as good as the red switches I liked.

Overall, I do not like this keyboard as much as the Keychron Q11, but it does
the job well enough that I will keep it as my daily driver at work. These
particular silent reds sound a little too loose, but are slightly quieter than
the regular reds. The keyboard feels a little bit less weighty, but the
advantage it has over the Q11 is that it has a dedicated "end" key!

OK, so my two main places I work and play at have been resolved. I decided I
wanted to go deeper into ergonomics and comfort. My next step had to be columnar
stagger.

### Keebio Iris V8 (Portable, on again and off again)

This keyboard cost me about $200 for the pre-built option off of
[keeb.io](https://keeb.io/). I did a lot of testing with printouts
[here](https://jhelvy.shinyapps.io/splitkbcompare/) to find the right columnar
stagger for me. I iterated through the Sofle v1, Sofle v2, Lily58, and Iris
before deciding on the Iris. I had almost bought a Sofle, but I realized the 5
bottom row thumb keys were hard to access. I wanted to be able to access all the
thumb keys at all times (more on this later). I went with the Iris as it had the
"best" thumb cluster for me while not having such an aggressive pinky stagger
like the Sofle v2.

At this point, I also wanted to dive into an alternate keyboard keymapping from
QWERTY. I had read that when switching to such a drastically different keyboard
layout, I might as well change keymapping as well. This will be a separate post
as I go through my ergo-mech journey. I can say as of today (4/21/24), I usually
use QWERTY at 90 wpm, and Colemak-DH at 30 wpm.

Once I received my keyboard, I suddenly realized I had to consider different key
profiles. I had really only used Cherry profile and was just exposed to OSA
keycaps with my Q11. I opted for some basic XDA keycaps that had a bunch of
extra keys that I figured I would haphazardly insert in as I try to figure out
my layout. I also realized I had to contend with how to program this thing.
Luckily, all keyboards from keeb.io using QMK firmware with VIA enabled so that
I can just use the web [VIA](https://usevia.app/) app to program my keyboard on
the fly.

I started to experiment with layouts by referencing a few others I had found
online, but really could not (and still have not) wrapped around the best layer
enables/toggles that work for me. This journey I'm sure will continue with my
next keyboard...

In parallel to experimenting with layers, I had started practicing my Colemak-DH
skills. I found sites like [Colemak Academy](https://www.colemak.academy/),
[keybr](https://www.keybr.com/), and [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) to be
the best online typing learning apps. It was hard, but I was determined to
re-learn how to type. I eventually dropped Colemak Academy and used keybr and
monkeytype custom. It took me about 2 weeks to get through all the letters in
keybr. monkeytype has me at 30 wpm.

I feel like my progress through this keyboard and layout hit a bit of a wall as
I still needed to work reasonably fast at work. I am at a work deadline and I
can't sacrifice typing speed at the moment. I have noticed that I can type both
layouts just fine with only a few seconds of ramp up. My muscle memory is tuned
more into each keyboards layout rather than to just typing.

Back to the wall, I also figured out that I do not like the upper 2 keys on the
thumb cluster that need my thumb to jump over a key to access. I started looking
at other potential keyboards that could address this. The Sofle v1 and Lily58
came back in to play. I ended upting for...

### Lily58 (En route)

I ordered this keyboard from [Ergomech.store](https://ergomech.store/) with an
acrylic case. The Lily58 is a split, columnar stagger, hot-swap, QMK/VIA enabled
keyboard. I love how few options the store has. I only had to choose whether I
wanted tenting and the casing. I bought my own Gateron Reds from Amazon.

### Chocopad V2

I ordered this from keeb.io as a backup for not having dedicated function keys.
It is a 16 key macropad (sounds almost like a numpad eh?). I currently use it as
more of a toy with my Mistel at work. I think it would pair well with a 65%
keyboard if I adopt it as my daily driver. I would have preferred a
[Yampad](https://customkbd.com/products/yampad-kit) that could function as a
dedicated numpad with layers, but it was just too expensive pre-assembled.

## The End (For Now)?

I expect the Lily58 keyboard to arrive tomorrow and do expect this to be the
"end" of my ergo-mech shopping journey for a long time. The Lily58 has the most
keys available to me with good positioning (at least hypothetically). I will
persist through learning layers and we'll see where that gets me. The thought of
moving to a 42 key board like a Corne scares me due to my desire/need. For me,
it would be an exercise in learning a skill rather than finding something that
alleviates and prevents pain while typing. I think my actual dream keyboard
would be a columnar stagger 75% keyboard. If no such keyboard comes to fruition
and the Lily58 doesn't work out, I might consider changing my QWERTY keyboards
layout to Colemak-DH.
