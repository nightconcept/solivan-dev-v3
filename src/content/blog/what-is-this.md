What is the purpose of this website? The combination of the URL & blog name, the
sidebar description and this nobody writer all reveal nothing about what this
place is. I think the best way to summarize really what this site is: this
website is a personal blog which can vary from some common topics that I think
about like politics and video games (development sometimes!) to macroeconomics
and marriage all in the pursuit of "developing" better writing. I don't really
know what I am going to talk about on each given post.

Why am I running this blog? This is not my first blog. I've had several over the
many years from when I started a blog as a wee lad (age 12 on Xanga, does anyone
else remember that?). I moved on quickly to Wordpress before it became the major
CMS
[running 39.5% of the internet in 2021](https://techjury.net/blog/percentage-of-wordpress-websites/)
when I was 15 with my own domain name and web hosting. I started a blog I wanted
to call crossover with my best friend at the time and we would show the
crossovers of our lives and talk about it. (Turns out despite being best
friends, we did not have a lot of life crossover and thus had little to write
about.) After my blogs died, I went on a website/webhosting hiatus leaving an
ominous splash page up for 10 years. So here I am running this blog. Oh wait, I
didn't answer the question. _Because I can._ As an adult, you can do whatever
you well please (generally at least within the confines of the law) because you
no longer have to impress anyone.

One other reason I am running this blog is that I am interested in learning new
things. Currently, this blog is running on the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
platform. This instance of Ghost is actually containerized on docker running
with evertramos'
[nginx-proxy-automation](https://github.com/evertramos/nginx-proxy-automation)
as a proxy. These containers are then run on a single droplet on DigitalOcean.
While this took me a lot longer than simply creating an account on Wordpress,
Medium, or Substack (like I would get any paid subscribers hah), I wanted to
learn something new (I've never used docker, nginx, Ghost, or DigitalOcean) and
I wanted full control. I don't even know if I will use that power, but I like
having it. This truly is my domain (pun intended) and I will wield (almost)
absolute power.

For a few weeks before this Ghost blog launched, I was actually running a
working container using
[DigitalOcean's fabulous Wordpress tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-docker-compose).
After installing, I just did not like how complex Wordpress has become. I also
did not like the default themes. I am much older now than when I started on WP
at 15 and I have come to value my time more. The "top" (yes, yes, not a good way
to find themes, but this does give some merit to those themes by filter of the
masses) themes just were not any good from my perspective. I have been way too
spoiled by generally unified UI/UX design from Google and Apple. I wanted to
enjoy looking at my blog. I wanted simplicity. Ghost's default themes happened
to fit that bill as I was looking for WP alternatives.

Enough about technology, I have one last point I want to touch on especially
before my political posts. In short: be civil. I am not a close-minded person
(or I like to think so). I'm open to ideas as long as they have good rationale
behind them. Using dubious sources (low factual reporting and/or
hyper-partisanship either direction according to
[this chart](https://adfontesmedia.com/)) or
[logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) is not going to convince
me to accept or change my view. That said, politically I am a registered
Democratic Socialist and I read the New York Times, but I believe in balancing
that with fiscal conservatism and balanced spending and read the Wall Street
Journal. I love America and would not live anywhere else. Ok, the exception
would probably be Finland while I have newborn children because men get
[164 days family leave](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/europe/finland-parental-leave-equality.html).
Other than that 'Murica.
