So, the election happened. Ignoring policy differences, I think my biggest
grievance is we chose an angry, immature man to run the most powerful country in
the world. I do not want to be in a world where this is OK especially for my
children. We should be able to respectfully disagree with each other and move
on. However, the ballots showed that as long as he delivers the economy this is
OK. Sorry, but I can't accept creating a toxic workplace in exchange for
supposed gains for people. I have a high level of certainty that my family and I
will be fine, but I do worry for those around us who are not as fortunate. I
will be living in a community with those who may not be as fortunate and if they
are pushed down, well my quality of life will suffer. It _is_ important to take
care of everyone around us. A rising tide raises all boats as they say.

So what am _I_ doing? Well, I've chosen to take this opportunity to disengage
with the toxic doom scrolling and internet. The election season is over so now I
do not have to "care" as much. I can't do anything until the next cycle. So
here's what's changing:

- I have a family who needs me to be present with them.
- My family deserves my energy and not the incoming toxic cycle of news that
  will inevitably flood all news sites. I do not regularly view The New York
  Times and The Hill anymore, but I definitely will not during the next four
  years.
- I will be focused on viewing only local news that affects my life. I am
  fortunate to live in a blue state that lines up with most of my ideals so I
  will generally be shielded from crazy-goings-ons of DC.
- I will be removing the Reddit front page from most of my browsing. It wastes
  time.
- I have other hobbies I want to do. This is a good opportunity to get on that.
- I will read more instead of aimlessly browsing my phone. My phone is just for
  communication.
- I will not actively seek news, but if someone tells me about it, I can look it
  up. I will not seek out opportunities to get fed news to make the excuse I
  need to look it up. This is meant to allow me to look at things that happen
  that are truly relevant to me.
- I will make less jokes about certain individuals I despise. It's not worth it
  anymore to say anything. It doesn't get me anywhere. It doesn't make me happy.
  That said, I do need to find an outlet for this anger. I can't bottle it up
  inside.

All in all, I want to take these next four years as a chance to grow and do
something productive for me. I will not wallow in loss.
