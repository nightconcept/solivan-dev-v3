I am going to start a collection of what would be Tweets or Twitlongers. All of
these will be thoughts too poorly thought out to be it's own post, but too long
to be a tweet. Every numbered section would have been a its own Tweet or
Twitlonger

\#1: I think I have something against Twitter. I use it to semi-promote this
blog to a very small audience. 18 followers as of this writing. I deleted all my
tweets recently due to privacy concerns. I jumped back only for this blog. I
installed the app and I started following people. I would say these are some
Twitter intellectuals. One of them has a blog that got me inspired to start my
own. I started down a dark path of comparison. Wrong. I violated the goal of
being myself.

I wanted to write some tweets, but I am on the very edge of do I want to go down
the path of constantly tweeting every thought I have and get sucked into the
Twittersphere? I do not. I have other things I value. In the meantime, I will
just use Twitter to see if I can snag a PS5. Probably to my wife's chagrin.

\#2: Maybe I won't buy a PS5. So many games on it are going to be
cross-platform, that I could live without the exclusives. I think maybe
Spider-Man might be the only one that I'm honestly not even sure I will play. I
have become way more picky about playing certain games.

\#3: My post velocity has dipped after the first two days which is no surprise.
I was out of town last weekend. Guess that's all the excuses I had. I think
these Tweets Collected posts will be great as I can spitball all of my good and
bad ideas out there and maybe it will mean something to someone. I do want this
to be a little neater than my journals I write in Notion. I think it makes sense
to continue doing both.

\#4: I have been thinking of better ways to catalogue my ideas.
[@WestleyDang](https://twitter.com/WestleyDang) has on his blog linking to
[Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I am
considering Obsidian given it's free and I'm not sure I want to pay into a
$15/mo tool. I am already trying to cut back on monthly subs and D+/Hulu has bit
the dust so far.

\#5: Monthly/yearly subscriptions are encroaching like crazy. I have to
constantly reassess whether it makes sense to maintain a sub to something as I
only have so much time in a day/month/year to actually use all the things I
want. It also helps we can share some services with multiple people like
Spotify/Nintendo Switch Online/Netflix.

\#6: Despite low posting frequency, I do have multiple posts going on in the
background! The writing is being done, but not published.

\#7: Do these Tweets collected need dates? Is that important information or is
it just another artifact of my need to digitally horde information? Is this need
to date related to how when we were kids we were expected to date all the papers
we wrote on the header next to our name?

\#8: Is every thought we have valuable? Does each one make us better? Even if
some of them are absolute shite?
